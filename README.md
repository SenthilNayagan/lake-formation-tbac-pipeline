# Introduction

TBACLakePermission makes use of the version-controlled *control file* to automate the entire flow of granting Lake Formation **tag-based access control** (**TBAC**) permissions on the Data Catalog resources to principals without the need to do so via the AWS console.

When designing a self-service analytical platform, "interactively" granting LF-TBAC permissions on Data Catalog resources to principals via console, CLI, or APIs is not an acceptable option.
