# Introduction

TBACLakePermission makes use of the version-controlled *control file* to automate the entire flow of granting Lake Formation **tag-based access control** (**TBAC**) permissions on the Data Catalog resources to principals without the need to do so via the AWS console. When designing a self-service analytical platform, "interactively" granting LF-TBAC permissions on Data Catalog resources to principals via console, CLI, or APIs is not an acceptable option. 

The TBAC permission begins with the *creation of LF-Tags*, followed by *assigning these LF-Tags to Data Catalog resources* such as databases, tables, and table columns. The last step is to *grant access permissions on the Data Catalog resources to principals using these LF-Tags*.
